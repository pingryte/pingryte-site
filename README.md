# Pingryte

**Tech, tools, and automation — without the fluff.**  
Pingryte is a minimalist, high-performance tech blog built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) using the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme.  
Hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), it's designed to be fast, clean, and practical — just like the content it shares.
