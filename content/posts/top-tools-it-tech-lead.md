People in tech love talking about tools — but half the time, it’s just for show. Here’s the stuff I actually use day-to-day as someone running IT and tech operations for a scaling company.

## 🧠 Productivity & Personal Setup

- **[MacBook Pro (M4 Pro)](https://amzn.to/4l0esEL)** – The best balance of power and portability. Quiet, fast, and never lets me down.
- **[MX Master 3S Mouse](https://amzn.to/4o7g7Lx)** – Ergonomics + customizable buttons = massive time saver.
- **[Apple Magic Keyboard with Touch ID (no numpad)](https://amzn.to/44Q5q8z)** – Clean, tactile, secure.

## 💻 Core Daily Tools

- **Chrome** – My default browser. Profiles, extensions, and dev tools all work well out of the box.
- **VS Code** – Lightweight, flexible, and just enough for infrastructure and scripting work.
- **iTerm2** – Better terminal. Tabs, profiles, and sane copy/paste.
- **[Raycast](https://raycast.com/?via=pingryte)** – App launcher, clipboard manager, and custom scripts. Replaced Spotlight entirely.
- **1Password** – Shared vaults, strong auth, and secure notes for everything from vendor creds to internal tokens.

## 🛠️ IT & Ops Stack

- **Okta** – The hub. SSO, lifecycle, and device trust policies all live here.
- **Google Workspace** – Email, Drive, Meet — no frills, but reliable.
- **Jamf + Intune** – Covers our Mac and Windows endpoints. Intune’s clunky, but necessary.
- **CrowdStrike Falcon** – Lightweight EDR that doesn’t slow down users or trigger false positives.
- **Workato** – The automation engine. Powers onboarding/offboarding, SaaS workflows, and lifecycle integrations.

## 🧹 Tools I Ditched

- **Notion** – Looks great, but got too expensive for what we needed. Switched to Confluence.
- **Moveworks** – Tried to use it as a ticket deflection bot, but required too much up-front work and constant tuning for diminishing returns.
