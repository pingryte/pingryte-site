## ðŸ§° Meet PlainUtils â€” A Clean Suite of Practical Web Tools

I recently launched [PlainUtils.com](https://plainutils.com) â€” a site built for people who need simple, no-nonsense tools without ads, bloat, or fluff. Whether you need a word counter, a base64 encoder, a JSON formatter, or a DNS lookup utility, PlainUtils is designed to be fast, minimal, and useful.

---

## ðŸ”§ How Itâ€™s Built

PlainUtils is built with a modern developer stack that's optimized for performance and simplicity:

- **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) with the App Router
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for clean, utility-first design
- **Hosting**: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) with automated GitHub deployments
- **Icons**: [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) for lightweight, consistent icons
- **Tool Search**: Keyboard-activated fuzzy search bar (press `/` to launch)
- **Build Strategy**: Fully static via `next export`, using `netlify.toml` for routing

Tools are modular and live under `/pages/tools/`. Each one has its own JSX file and shares layout/components with the rest of the app.

## âœ¨ Highlights

- **Lightning fast** thanks to static export
- **No cookies, no tracking**
- **Fully responsive** across devices
- **Extendable** â€” adding a new tool is dead simple
- **Accessible UI** with proper labels and keyboard support

## ðŸ§ª Local Dev Setup

Want to see how it works?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pingryte/plainutils
cd plainutils-nextjs
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and play around.

## ðŸ¤” Why I Built It

PlainUtils started as a small challenge â€” I wanted to see if I could pull it off and get more hands-on with this stack. I'd used all the tools in isolation, but this was a great excuse to tie it together into something clean and practical.

No ads, no tracking, no fluff â€” just useful utilities in one place.

## ðŸ§  Whatâ€™s Next

- More tools (IP checker, QR generator, timestamp converter, etc.)
- Easier discoverability
- Dark mode refinements
- Maybe a Chrome extension?
